## What is Vibe-Coding with an LLM?

[Vibe coding](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vibe_coding){:target=_blank} is a programming approach that leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) to assist in writing code. It involves using AI tools to generate, complete, or suggest code snippets based on natural language prompts or partial code inputs. This method can significantly speed up the coding process, help overcome writer's block, and provide creative solutions to programming challenges.

## Why Use Vibe-Coding for the Altair 8800?

The Altair 8800 is a vintage microcomputer that has a unique architecture and programming environment. Vibe-Coding can help modern developers interact with this classic system by:

- Generating code snippets compatible with the Altair's architecture.
- Providing explanations and documentation for legacy programming concepts.
- Assisting in debugging and optimizing code for the Altair.

## Getting Started with Vibe-Coding for the Altair 8800

1. **Choose an LLM Tool**: Select a Large Language Model platform that supports code generation, such as OpenAI's GPT-4, Codex, or similar services.
2. **Set Up Your Environment**: Ensure you have access to the Altair 8800 emulator or hardware, along with any necessary development tools.
3. **Define Your Goals**: Clearly outline what you want to achieve with your Altair programming project.
4. **Craft Prompts**: Write clear and specific prompts to guide the LLM in generating relevant code snippets.
5. **Iterate and Refine**: Use the generated code as a starting point, test it on the Altair, and refine it as needed.

## Altair Emulator IO Port SDK

Sample code in the **AppSamples/sdk** folder demonstrates how to use the IO port features via a C language SDK. For details, see the [SDK samples](https://github.com/gloveboxes/Altair-8800-Emulator/tree/main/src/AppSamples/sdk){:target=_blank}. These examples are also helpful for LLM-assisted development and [Vibe-Coding](01-Vibe-Coding.md) for C, Microsoft Basic, and Assembly programming.

## Leverage existing code samples

Point the LLM to existing code samples in the [AppSamples](https://github.com/gloveboxes/Altair-8800-Emulator/tree/main/src/AppSamples){:target=_blank} folder. These samples can provide valuable context and inspiration for your prompts.

- sdk/dxtimer.c
- breakout.c
- tetris.c
- onboard.c

Are great examples how to use the IO ports and other features such as timers and VT100 terminal control characters of the Altair 8800 for Vibe-Coding.

When crafting prompts for the LLM, consider including references to existing documentation and manuals for the Altair 8800. This can help the model generate more accurate and contextually relevant code. Useful resources include:

## Example Prompts for Vibe-Coding

- "Write a BASIC program for the Altair 8800 that calculates the factorial of a number."
- "Explain how to set up I/O ports on the Altair 8800."

## Best Practices

- **Review Generated Code**: Always review and test the code generated by the LLM to ensure it meets your requirements and is free of errors.
- **Combine with Traditional Coding**: Use Vibe-Coding as a supplement to your traditional coding practices.
- **Stay Updated**: Keep abreast of advancements in LLM technology to leverage new features and capabilities.

## Conclusion

Vibe-Coding with an LLM can be a powerful tool for programming the Altair 8800, making it easier to navigate its unique challenges and unlock its potential. By integrating AI into your development workflow, you can enhance productivity and creativity in your projects.
