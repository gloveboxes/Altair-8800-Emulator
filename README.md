# Cloud Enabled Altair 8800 on Azure Sphere

The Altair 8800 is considered to be the computer that kick-started the personal computer revolution. You can learn more about the Altair on the [Altair 8800 Wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Altair_8800?azure-portal=true).

The Cloud Enabled Altair 8800 Emulator in C for Unix-like operating systems:

1. Runs on Unix-like operating systems, including Linux, Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL2), macOS, and Raspberry Pi OS.
1. Is a sister project to the [Azure Sphere Cloud Enabled Altair 8800](https://github.com/AzureSphereCloudEnabledAltair8800).

The Altair 8800 was built on the [Intel 8080](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intel_8080?azure-portal=true) CPU, the second 8-bit microprocessor manufactured by Intel in 1974. By today's standards, it's a simple CPU design, perfect for learning computing fundamentals because of its small instruction set.

The original Altair 8800 was programmed directly via the front panel. It was a painstaking, error-prone process to load and run a program. The Altair 8800 had a series of LEDs and switches that you used to load apps and determine the state of the Altair.

You could save and load applications from a paper tape reader connected to the Altair 8800. As the Altair 8800 grew in popularity, more options became available. You could attach a keyboard, a computer monitor, and finally disk drives, a more reliable way to save and load applications.
