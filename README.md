# Welcome to the AI and Cloud powered Altair 8800 Everywhere project

## Documentation

Navigate to the [Altair 8800 Project docs](https://gloveboxes.github.io/altair_8800_docs/) for the complete documentation.

## Introduction

Welcome to the Altair 8800 emulator repo. If you are interested in [retrocomputing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retrocomputing), software development, computer fundamentals, and cloud services you've arrived at the right repo.

The Altair 8800 kick-started the personal computer revolution. You can learn more about the Altair on the [Altair 8800 Wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Altair_8800?azure-portal=true).

The Altair 8800 Emulator runs on [POSIX](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/POSIX) compatible operating systems including Raspberry Pi, Desktop Linux, [Windows Subsystem for Linux](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install), and macOS on Apple Silicon and Intel.

The project introduces computer fundamentals with a climate sustainability theme and software development. The Altair project can run standalone and is a fantastic safe way to explore machine-level programming, Intel 8080 Assembly programming, along with C and BASIC development. All the source code is provided under an MIT License.

Optionally, the project integrates with free cloud services from [Open Weather Map](http://openweathermap.org) weather and pollution services, along with [Azure IoT Central](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-au/services/iot-central/), and [Azure Anomaly Detection Cognitive Service](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/cognitive-services/anomaly-detector/).


## What you'll learn

What will you learn about:

- Safe low-level machine and assembly programming.
- Software development in BASIC and C.
- Programming the Altair 8800 emulator with the virtual front panel.
- How to extend the Intel 8080 input/output ports to integrate with cloud services.
- Weather and pollution cloud services
- Azure services, including IoT, Stream Analytics, Anomaly detection.

## Altair 8800 history

The Altair 8800 was built on the [Intel 8080](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intel_8080?azure-portal=true) CPU, the second 8-bit microprocessor manufactured by Intel in 1974. By today's standards, it's a simple CPU design, perfect for learning computing fundamentals because of its small instruction set.

The original Altair 8800 was programmed by setting switches on the front panel. It was a painstaking, error-prone process to load and run a program. The Altair 8800 had a series of LEDs and switches that you used to load apps and determine the state of the Altair.

You could save and load applications from a paper tape reader connected to the Altair 8800. As the Altair 8800 grew in popularity, more options became available. You could attach a keyboard, a computer monitor, and finally disk drives, a more reliable way to save and load applications.
